## 🎯 **Key Findings:**

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- The **first private key** (`sharp-emerald`) is the one that has administrative control over your contracts
- This address likely has the necessary capabilities (IssuerCap, AdminCap) for contract management
- Keep these private keys secure - they control your deployed contracts
- The addresses shown here are what you should import into your OneChain wallet to interact with your contracts
